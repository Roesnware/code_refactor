# Module 1 challenge 

## Description

My motivation whilst creating this repository was to display my skills and knowledge gained from module one of bootcamp. I built this project around source code provided in the course instructions and edited ther code to adhere to the specifications from the client for Horisean Marketings website and make it more search engine friendly. I was able to accomplish this by altering the HTML code to include only semantic elements and fix the css styling sheet to fit in with the changes, I also added alt aspects to images making their site more readable and user friendly. I learned how to break down and reverse engineer code in HTML, style the website using a styling sheet in CSS, make the website user friendly using alt aspects.
